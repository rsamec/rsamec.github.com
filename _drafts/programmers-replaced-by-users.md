I personally don't like the posts that describe general author's feelings without arguments supported author's statements.
I like post with concrete examples, with description of technical implementation, with code snippets.
This post will be an exception. I promise it will be short and I'll go straight to the point.

# Too many revolutions

There are many revolutions in developing a typical web application.

+   Web components revolutions
+   SPA applications using various client MVC* frameworks (angular, knockout, backbone, ember, etc.)
+   language revolutions - TypeScript, Dart, Closure, ATScript
+   DOM - object observe revolutions
+   ES6 revolutions - class constructs, generators, promise
+   React
+   isomorfic applications
+   no backend applications

These standards, components, libraries are great and simplifies a lot work needed to be done when developing a typical business line application.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">The only true revolution is the shift from programmers to users when building web applications.</div>

These technologies, languages, components enables to increase the level of abstraction when expressing the intent of your web application.
Many technical details are hidden to users.

You can look at web components as lego blocks that enables to users with knowledge of HTML markup to build applications from them.
The typical user don't know markup languages, it will be not able to use web components. 
 

## Final notes

I think it is a great news for people people working in industries

This shift is good for companies (no in house programmers needed), but i think it is good also for programmers (they can concentrate on "real" software).
